        // Step 1: Define the core concept of the program - generating movie posters with colored barcodes.

        // Step 2: Design the user interface (UI) for the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        // Include elements for uploading movie frames, selecting silhouette images, choosing poster sizes,
        // resizing elements, and previewing designs.

        // Step 3: Implement backend logic in C# for processing movie frames, extracting colors, generating colored barcodes,
        // handling silhouette integration, and preserving original colors.
        // Use C# libraries for image processing and barcode generation if needed.

        // Step 4: Develop frontend interactivity using JavaScript to allow users to:
        // - Choose poster sizes and resize elements dynamically.
        // - Upload movie frames and silhouette images.
        // - Preview and customize poster designs with dynamic generation of barcode lines.

        // Step 5: Integrate frontend and backend components to ensure seamless communication between user interactions,
        // data processing, and visual presentation.
        // Implement logic to overlay colored barcode elements onto silhouette images while preserving original colors
        // in specified areas.

        // Step 6: Add functionality for users to export finalized poster designs as print-ready PDF files.
        // Handle PDF generation based on user-selected poster sizes and design configurations.

        // Step 7: Conduct thorough testing of the application to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and usability
        // across different devices and screen sizes.
        // Gather feedback from users and iterate on the design and functionality based on user testing results.
